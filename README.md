# Priority based Round Robin Algorithm Cloudsim
In this project, I implemented the **Priority based Round Robin Algorithm on Cloudsim 3.0.3**. In this project, cloudlet.java has been changed. By default, this project includes 4 vms with different resources, each cloudlet includes a priority for scheduling tasks. First, for better performance, all cloudlets are sorted according to priority,A lower numerical value indicates a higher priority, for example, the number **1** has the highest priority.

## Simulator Used
- [Cloudsim 3.0.3](https://github.com/Cloudslab/cloudsim)

## How to Use
Download the code and add it in the example package and run as usual. This code has been implemented during the initial time of my research to learn more about **clousim**.

If you want to implement **Weighted Round Robin Algorithm on Cloudsim** algorithm you can have a look at this repository [here](https://github.com/pouyakz/weighted-round-robin-cloudsim/tree/main).
